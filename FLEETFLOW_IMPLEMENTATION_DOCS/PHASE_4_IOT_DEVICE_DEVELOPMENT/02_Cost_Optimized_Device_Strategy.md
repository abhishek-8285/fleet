**This strategy**:
- Gets you to market 12 months faster
- Provides immediate revenue generation  
- Builds customer base with low-risk entry
- Allows for natural upselling as customers succeed
- Aligns perfectly with "affordable for all" philosophy

**Bottom line**: Build a Maruti first, then offer BMW features to those who want to pay for them. The Indian market will reward you for understanding their budget realities.
